	bc-emit.[ch] files.

	* argopt.c: 

2005-05-28    <s@large.org>

	* main.c: Added the direct supprot for various options, using
	argopt.c, and programs output is directed to xvcg through pipe.

2005-05-21    <s@large.org>

	* gram.y: Added the support for invisible near edge between the
	case node of switch. See at 
	                           SWITCH '(' expr ')' statement
				   
				   Rule.

	* gram.y: all edge set using struct nodtyp {node,type}
	so all edges can be set by crtoutsedgs () function.

	As well as I am trying to add the support for "label" and "goto"
	statement.

	* c2vcg.h: add a new 
	typedef struct {
	                int node;
	                Sttyp type;
	               } nodtyp;

	for outs, cnt, .. etc nodes of Flows.
